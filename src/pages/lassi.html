            LAssi or labeling assistant is a project based on the problem of label assignment for publications. What
            looks
            at first glance easy is a challenging problem when each publication can have many different labels and there
            exists a huge set of labels to choose from. LAssi is build to support an expert during the labeling process
            of
            new publications using information from already labeled ones.

            The first question that arrises is always why not using machine learning? The reason is, that for
            multi-label
            problems the classification algorithms reach only mediocre performance. And with each addition of
            low-quality
            labels the overall label set quality declines until the database is not ueful anymore. <a class="link"
