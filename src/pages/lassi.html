    <p>

        LAssi or labeling assistant is a project based on the problem of label assignment for publications. What looks
        at first glance easy is a challenging problem when each publication can have many different labels and there
        exists a huge set of labels to choose from. LAssi is build to support an expert during the labeling process of
        new publications using information from already labeled ones.

        The first question that arrises is always why not using machine learning? The reason is, that for multi-label
        problems the classification algorithms reach only mediocre performance. And with each addition of low-quality
        labels the overall label set quality declines until the database is not ueful anymore. <a class="link"
