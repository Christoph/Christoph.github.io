        Online Tool</a> or labeling assistant is a project based on the problem
      of label assignment for publications. What looks
      at first glance easy is a challenging problem when each publication can have many different labels,
      and there exists a massive set of labels to choose from. I built LAssi to support an expert during the labeling
      process of new publications using already labeled ones.

      The first question that arises is always, why not using machine learning? The reason is that for
      multi-label
      problems, the classification algorithms reach only mediocre performance. And with each addition of
      low-quality
      labels the overall label set quality declines until the database is no longer useful.
