        Blackbox
        Viewer</span>
    <p>
        The goal of Blackbox Viewer is to allow experts to validate and analyse models based on input and output values.
        The name referes to the fact that I treat all models as black boxes without knowing their internals while
        supporting users in their tasks of understanding such models.

    <p>
        The left side shows all input parameters and the right side all output parameters. The user can through brushing
        and linking understand how different parametrizations of a model result in different output values.
