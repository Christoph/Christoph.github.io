    <span class="content-title">Welcome!</span>
    <p>
        I am a Research Assistant (Pre-Doc) at the University of Vienna. My main research interests are
        </i><i>Visualization</i></i> and <i>Human Computer Interaction</i> with a
        strong
        focus on <i>Explainable Machine
            Learning</i>.
        This allows users to use complex machine learning methods (<a class="link" href="#tagrefinery"><i
                class="fad fa-industry-alt"></i> TagRefinery</a>) as well as
        understanding machine learning models and their results (
        <a class="link" href="#black"><i class="fad fa-analytics"></i> Blackbox Viewer</a>,
        <a class="link" href="#emb"><i class="fad fa-chart-pie"></i> EmbComp</a>
        ).
        Text data is a datatype I am working a lot with during my projects.
        From text wrangling and preprocessing (
        <a class="link" href="#tagrefinery"><i class="fad fa-industry-alt"></i> TagRefinery</a>),
        understanding of text embeddings and text representations
        (<a class="link" href="#emb"><i class="fad fa-chart-pie"></i> EmbComp</a>) to information retrieval based on
        text
        features (
        <a class="link" href="#lassi"><i class="fad fa-tags"></i>
            LAssi</a>).

        Supervising and leading people is a passion I discovered during my time as a software tester at
        Anton Paar
        GmbH
        where I build a software test team.
        As a lecturer and supervisor I am able to support students during the problem definition,
        realization, and
        evaluation steps of their projects which is a deeply satisfying process.
