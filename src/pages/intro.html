      The motivation to understand and solve complex problems is the driving force behind my development from the apprenticeship to my Ph.D. The importance of understanding the perspectives and requirements of different stakeholders and learning to bridge the gap between those is the biggest lesson I learned on that journey. Teaching for four years the concepts of "Visualization and Visual Data Analysis" and "Human-Computer-Interaction" to students deepened my understanding of effective visual communication.

      Hello, I am doing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Vienna.
      During my bachelor in earth sciences, I realized how much potential and challenges
      are at the interface between humans and machines. My goal was from that moment on to bridge this gap between
      computer science and people with challenges.
      <span class="text-highlight">Machine Learning</span> became the obvious solution, but after
      my first projects, I realized that these methods have severe shortcomings.
      As a researcher and teacher for both <span class="text-highlight">Visualization</span> and
      <span class="text-highlight">Human-Computer Interaction/UX Experience</span>, I realized that
      these methods provide the framework for <span class="text-highlight">communicating</span> and
      <span class="text-highlight">validating</span> results created from machine learning systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In machine learning, the subfield of <span class="text-highlight">natural language processing</span>
      became a passion for me. Language is an ever-changing target, and there are no simple algorithmic solutions.
      Bringing the human back into the loop is either necessary or improves the results significantly.
      Along those lines, I worked on projects to understand and analyze topic models
      , compare text embeddings
      , validate simulation models
      , preprocess tag data
      ), and support
      users in their data labeling process with information retrieval methods
      .
