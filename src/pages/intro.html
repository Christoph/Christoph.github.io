            I am a Research Assistant (Pre-Doc) at the University of Vienna. My main research interests are
            <span class="text-highlight">Visualization</span> and <span class="text-highlight">Human Computer
                Interaction/UX</span> with a
            strong
            focus on <span class="text-highlight">Explainable AI</span>.
            This allows users to use complex machine learning methods (<a class="link" href="#tagrefinery"><i
                    class="fad fa-industry-alt"></i> TagRefinery</a>) as well as
            understanding models and their results (
            <a class="link" href="#black"><i class="fad fa-analytics"></i> Blackbox Viewer</a>,
            <a class="link" href="#emb"><i class="fad fa-chart-pie"></i> EmbComp</a>
            ).
            Understanding textual data is a specific passion of mine.
            From text wrangling and preprocessing (
            <a class="link" href="#tagrefinery"><i class="fad fa-industry-alt"></i> TagRefinery</a>),
            understanding of correlations and content of text collections
            (<a class="link" href="#emb"><i class="fad fa-chart-pie"></i> EmbComp</a>) to information retrieval (
            <a class="link" href="#lassi"><i class="fad fa-tags"></i>
                LAssi</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="text-highlight">Supervising </span> and <span class="text-highlight">leading </span> people is
            a passion I first discovered during my time as a lead of software test
            team at Anton Paar GmbH.
            As a lecturer and supervisor I am able to support students during their problem definition, realization, and
            evaluation steps of their projects which is a deeply satisfying process.
