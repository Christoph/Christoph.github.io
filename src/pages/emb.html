      <span class="text-highlight">Abstract:</span> <br> This work introduces embComp, a novel approach
      for comparing two
      embeddings
      that
      capture the similarity between
      objects, such as word and document embeddings. We survey scenarios where comparing these embedding
      spaces is
      useful. From those scenarios, we derive common tasks, introduce visual analysis methods that support
      these
      tasks, and combine them into a comprehensive system. One of embComp's central features are overview
      visualizations that are based on metrics for measuring differences in local structure around
      objects.
      Summarizing these local metrics over the embeddings provides global overviews of similarities and
      differences.
      These global views enable a user to identify sets of interesting objects whose relationships in the
      embeddings
      can be compared. Detail views allow comparison of the local structure around selected objects and
      relating
      this
      local information to the global views. Integrating and connecting all of these components, \sysname
      supports
      a
      range of analysis workflows that help understand similarities and differences between embedding
      spaces. We
      assess our approach by applying it in several use cases, including understanding corpora differences
      via
      word
      vector embeddings, and understanding algorithmic differences in generating embeddings.
