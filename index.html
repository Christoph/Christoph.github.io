		<strong>Expertise</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Working now around half a year with social music tags.
			<li>Decent Java knowledge.
		</ul>
		
		<h3> Description </h3>
		Tag Refinery is a visual supported social tag cleaning tool. In today's world we can find everywhere tags: movies, music, papers and many more. Those should help us find want we want or 
		help us finding new interesting things. Here I am going to use the million song database as dataset for Tag Refinery to improve the quality of the tags. Why? Social tags like those 
		in last.fm give additional information but with the drawback of having no strict rules about language, spelling or the meaning of a word. That adds a lot of noise to the information that 
		the tags would provide. Especially if you want to get deeper insight into the given topic its important to find spelling error, synonyms and words which are connected. 
		
		Doing this clean-up is no easy task and this tool should support it with an visual interface. The visualization should help the user deciding with parameters are the correct ones for his
		problem e.g. tags. The cleaning pipeline consists of three different parts and each part has a set of parameters.
		
		<h4> Goals </h4>
		The whole visualization should provide the user with all informations needed to decide with parameter combination leads to the best output. The underlying algorithm has three parts:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Removing spelling errors:</strong> The tool should give the user direct feedback which words are going to be substituted by the algorithm given the chosen parameters.
			<li><strong>Finding word groups:</strong> Another important part is finding words which should be grouped, like "hard-rock" instead of "hard" and "rock".
			<li><strong>Removing non informative tags:</strong> At this point each tag gets an weight which takes into account the listeners, total playcount and the lastfm weight. Tags with a value below a certain threshold will be removed.
		</ul>

		<h3> Proposed Solution </h3>
		<strong>Target:</strong> A visual interface which let the user easily manipulate the cleaning pipeline and gives "instant" feedback about the output.
		</br></br>
		<strong>Tasks:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Getting an overview of the tag space (Filtering, zooming)
			<li>Parametrize the algorithm 
			<li>Check the processed tags
			<li>Get information for a better parameter combination
			<li>Iterate through the last three tasks until the user is satisfied with the output
		</ul>
		
		</br><strong>Mockup 1:</strong>
		<img src="images/Tableau.png" alt="Tableau">
		The first Mockup is an Tableau Dashboard. It uses the great data exploration capabilities Tableau provides. The data is visualized through a word cloud which seems to be a reasonable 
		way of giving the user feedback what the algorithm output is. </br>
		<strong>Pros:</strong> This interface provides a good overview and a simple UI.</br> 
		<strong>Cons:</strong> Its not clear how the different steps of the algorithm (the parameters) affect the solution.
		
		</br></br><strong>Mockup 2:</strong>
		<img src="images/Website.png" alt="D3">
		The second Mockup is a D3 Page. Here are more detailed graphs about how the parameters influence the data. On the top left and right 
		corner are text fields which are connected (The same tags are in both lists). This provides the user with detailed about how a special tag develops. Between those are the parameter controls. 
		At the lower border are three graphs. Each corresponds to one refining step. The left one shows as histogram the number of replacements. The 2
		bin shows how many words replace two other words. The middle graph is a heatmap where the size is the connection strength between those two tags.
		The right graph is related to computed weight for each tag. It shows as histogram the distribution of the weight and highlights the cutoff-point.</br> 
		<strong>Pros:</strong> A lot of information about the impact of the different steps and the possibility to see how a tag develops.</br> 
		<strong>Cons:</strong> The overview is not as good as in the first Mockup.
		
		</br></br><strong>Mockup 3:</strong>
		<img src="images/Dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard">
		This Mockup is an crossover of the last two. It merges the two text fields of the last Mockup again into a word cloud which is in my oppinion the better visualization.
		Tableau provides easy ways of filtering and scaling the cload whiich futher improves the way the user might interact with the tag cloud. In addition are the three graphs 
		explained in the last Mockup. These should provide enough detailed information if needed and be ignored otherwise.</br>
		<strong>Pros:</strong> It provides an overview and details on one screen. Linking between the different graphs is possible. This may improve the insight for the user.  </br> 
		<strong>Cons:</strong> Again this might be a too complex interface. The user cant see how a single tag develops: "hard rock zasdj" -> "hard-rock"
		
		
		
		<h3> Scenario </h3>
		
		<h3> Implementation </h3>
		<strong>Preferred solution:</strong>
		AngularJS + D3 on client side and Python (django) on server side. </br>
		I have not enough/no experience with the proposed tools. That would mean a lot of background work which has nothing to do with visualization.</br>
		</br>
		<strong>Possible solutions:</strong>
		Using the existing Java code and accessing it with a local D3 page or Tableau.</br>
		
		<h3> Milestones </h3>
		At this point there are too many unknowns for meaningful plan.
