		<h3> Description </h3>
		Tag Refinery is a visual supported social tag cleaning tool. In today's world we can find everywhere tags: movies, music, papers and many more. Those should help us find want we want or 
		help us finding new interesting things. Here I am going to use the million song database as dataset for Tag Refinery to improve the quality of the tags. Why? Social tags like those 
		in last.fm give additional information but with the drawback of having no strict rules about language, spelling or the meaning of a word. That adds a lot of noise to the information that 
		the tags would provide. Especially if you want to get deeper insight into the given topic its important to find spelling error, synonyms and words which are connected. 
		
		Doing this clean-up is no easy task and this tool should support it with an visual interface. The visualization should help the user deciding with parameters are the correct ones for his
		problem e.g. tags. The cleaning pipeline consists of three different parts and each part has a set of parameters.
		
		<h4> Goals </h4>
		<ul>
			<li>The user wants to find spelling errors: The tool should give the user direct feedback which words are going to be substituted by the algorithm given the chosen parameters. The parameters are : Phonetic algorithm used and the acceptance threshold.
			<li>Finding words which should stick together: The next step is finding words which should be one like hard-rock. This part is under construction.
			<li>Removing rare and non informative tags: That step should be supported by a nive graph showing the distribution of the tags and let the user decide at whcih point tags are non informative. in Addition the graph gives insight into how the chosen weights influence the weights of the tags.
		</ul>
		
		<h3> Proposed Solution </h3>
		Target: A visual interface which let the user easily manipulate the cleaning pipeline and gives "instant" feedback.
		
		<h3> Expertise </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Working now around a half year with social music tags.
			<li>Decent knowledge about Java (The algorithm is written in Java).
			<li>Not that much knowledge about web development and javascript.
			<li>Earth Sciences Bac ;)
