      <h3 id="section1">Idea</h3>
      <p>Vestigare is a project idea around on the fly text analysis of website content. Words forms our imagination and world, therefore is it important to understand what we read and how this text affects our reasoning. The key points are: easy usablity for everyone, analysis using statistical and natural language processing methods and smart visualizations.</p>
      <p><strong>Vestigare</strong> is latin and stands for detect or trace something. Which should be in this case informations about the person/institution who has written the analysed text/website.</p>
      <h3>Concept</h3>
      <p>The main concept is a server/client system which has a website and a chrome plugin as clients. The user can use the plugin to analyse the text content of a site by simply openening the tool. Which measures and visualizations there are is not fixed now and any input is highly appreciated. Currently i think about simple measures like who often words and word groups appear and in which context they appear. The second client is a website which gives you the possibility to upload multiple texts and compare them. As example what i have in mind is the comparrison of a news topic over multiple news sites or the comparison of political speeches.</p>
      <p>Whatever the final project includes an easy accesiblity for everyone is my main target.</p>
      <p>If you have ideas or you are interested in talking about the project, send me a mail! </p>
